# Passwords
Passwords are a fundamental aspect of digital security, serving as the primary method of user authentication for most online systems. When you create a password, it isn't typically stored in plaintext form. Instead, it's transformed into a 'hash', a unique string of characters generated by a one-way function known as a hashing algorithm. This ensures that even if a system's password data is compromised, the actual passwords aren't immediately exposed, providing an extra layer of security. It's always essential to create robust, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance your protection against potential breaches.

#### Hashing
Hashing is a process that takes an input (like a password) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, typically in the form of a hash code.
A key feature of a good hashing function is that it is computationally infeasible to regenerate the original input value (password) from the hashed output. This makes it a one-way function.

Hashing is preferred over symmetric encryption for storing passwords due to the following reasons:

- Security - It's extremely difficult to convert the hash back to the original password, given the one-way nature of the hash function.
- Non-reversibility - With symmetric encryption, if you have the key, you can decrypt the password and discover its original plaintext form. This is not possible with hashed passwords, because hashing is a one-way function.
- No need for key management - because there is no key
- Consistency - Hashing algorithms always produce the same hash for the same input, so it's easy to verify a password by re-hashing it and comparing to the stored hash.

#### Rainbow Tables

A rainbow table is a database that is used to gain authentication by cracking the password hash. It is a precomputed dictionary of plaintext passwords and their corresponding hash values that can be used to find out what plaintext password produces a particular hash. Since more than one text can produce the same hash, itâ€™s not important to know what the original password really was, as long as it produces the same hash. 

The MD5 password hash below is generated from a string of 16 random generated characters. And is not found by the rainbow table.

When comparing my hashed password (12345) with the one of my peer, we saw that the hash are different.

Salting is commonly used in conjunction with hashing. A salt (random data) is added to the password before hashing, making the hash even more difficult to crack as it adds randomness to each hash, preventing the use of precomputed tables for attacks (like rainbow tables).

When a user sets a password:
1. A new random salt is generated.
2. The salt is combined with the password (often simply appended or prepended to it).
3. This combination of salt and password is then hashed.
4. The system stores both the salt and the hash in its database.

It can prevent rainbow table attacks, because each salt value would need a separate rainbow table.
